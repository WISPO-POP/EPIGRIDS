This is an entirely synthetic power system network model that covers the geographic footprint of the Eastern Interconnection states:
(Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington DC, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas).  
The full geographic area of each state is included in this model, resulting in the State of Texas being fully modeled as part of the Eastern Grid Model
The case is designed with a 765, 500, 345, 230, 138 and 69 kV transmission network to serve a load that roughly mimics the actual population of its 
geographic footprint. The synthetic transmission system was designed by algorithms described in [1] 
to be statistically similar to actual transmission system models but without modeling any actual lines.

This is a synthetic power system model that does not represent the actual grid. It was developed as part of the 
US ARPA-E GRID DATA research project and contains no CEII.
