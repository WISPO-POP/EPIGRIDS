# Synthetic Network Models

These cases are entirely synthetic electric grids that cover various portions of the United States. The synthetic transmission systems were designed by algorithms described in [1] to be statistically similar to actual transmission system models but without modeling any actual transmission lines.

When publishing results based on these grid models, please cite:

This is a synthetic electric grid model that does not represent the actual grid. It was developed as part of the US ARPA-E GRID DATA research project and contains no CEII.
